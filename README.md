## What is this repo for?

This repo is for core files only. You need to visit our website or block repository to find more info.


## Support

Maintaining a quality blocking project takes a lot of time. Energized Protection is completely independently funded. We fight for our users. This does mean
however that we also have to spend our owns to pay the bills. This is where you can help: by chipping in you can ensure more time is spent improving Energized rather than dealing with distractions.

This donation is for our services, not for any pack, resource or any other mean. Your support will help us keep the project running and provide you quality service.
